# Validation
We might want to validate gridded data or point data against the observation data or station data. Using validation functionality of CDT, we can validate spatial points data in CDT format, gridded data in netCDF format or even validate multiple datasets at once.


Topics included in this chapter are:

* Validating spatial points data (in CDT format)
* Validating gridded data (in netCDF format)
* Validating multiple datasets

## Validating spatial points data (in CDT format)
We can validate spatial points data for rainfall and temperature against CDT station data. The validation statistic can be displayed in formats such as table and map. We can also validate 


## Validating gridded data (in netCDF format)
We can also validate gridded netcdf data for both rainfall and temperature data.

### Validating multiple datasets
We also have the option of validating multiple datasets (in CDT data format) against station observation data. We can do this for both rainfall and temperature data.
