# Analysis
We might want to validate gridded data or point data against the observation data or station data. Using validation functionality of CDT, we can validate spatial points data in CDT format, gridded data in netCDF format or even validate multiple datasets at once.


Topics included in this chapter are:

* Calculating summary statistics
* Compute climate variables
* Compute climatologies
* Spatial analysis
* Daily rainfall analysis
* Rainy season characteristics
* Rainy season analysis
* Climate extreme indices
* Drought indices


## Calculating summary statistics
We can use CDT to calculate different summary statistics and show them in summary table. We can also look at summary graphs to have a visual understanding of the data under study. We can use both CDT stations data format and CDT dataset format (gridded) for calculating these summary statistics.


## Compute climate variables
We can compute different climate variables. The options are:

* Temperature variables
* Potential evapotranspiration and
* Water balance

### Temperature variables

### Potential evapotranspiration

### Water balance

## Compute climatologies

Under this, we can compute both climatologies and anomalies.

### Climatologies

### Compute anomalies

## Spatial analysis
This is a very powerful feature in CDT which allows users to conduct different analysis on either CDT stations data format or CDT dataset format (gridded). We can do different kinds of time series aggregation based on different conditions. Output time series can be viewed in different time step formats such as monthlty, seasonal and annual. Different types of time series graph are also also generated, which are line plot, barplot, probability graph, line and bar graph indicating ENSO years, graph with ENSO probability and anomaly plot.

## Daily rainfall analysis
This allows to conduct different analysis on daily rainfall data. We can compute seasonal daily statistics such as total rainfall, rainfall intensity, number of wet days, number of dry days, number of wet spells, number of dry spells. We can also calculate yearly seasonal statistics such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, probability of exceeding etc. In doing so, we can manually define wet/dry day. Finally, these results can also be visualized.

## Rainy season characteristics
We can calculate different characteristics if rainy season such as season onset, season cessation and season length.

### Season onset

### Season cessation

### Season length

## Rainy season analysis
We can conduct different analysis of rainy season and we can show rainy season analysis in term of line plot, barplot, probability graph, line and bar graph indicating ENSO years, graph with ENSO probability and anomaly plot.

## Climate extreme indices
We can compute different climate extreme indices in terms of both rainfall and temperature.

### Precipitation data

### Temperature data

## Drought indices
We can compute different drought indices in CDT. These are:

1. Standardized precipitation index (SPI)
2. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)
3. Decile

### Standardized precipitation index (SPI)

### Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)

### Decile
