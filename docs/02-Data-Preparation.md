# Data Preparation

## CDT station data format

The format of CDT station data. 

## Manipulating CDT station data

### Merge two CDT station data

### Filtering CDT station data

### Selecting CDT station data

## Assess data availability

## Download data using CDT

### Download digital elevation model
### Download different country administrative boundaries or shapefile
### Download satellite rainfall estimates data
### Download reanalysis data

## Aggregate data
### Aggregating time series
### Aggregate/disaggregate spatial NetCDF data

## Transform NetCDF files into CDT dataset

## Data extraction
CDT allows users to extract data from NetCDF gridded data. We can extract data by coordinates of a single point, by coordinates of multiple points, by rectangle, by one polygon or even multiple polygons. We show here how to extract data using all these options. 

## Split NetCDF files into CDT NetCDF format
Sometimes NetCDF files have many more dimensions, for example, one NetCDF file might contain values for multiple years in a single file.

## Data format conversion

### Conversion to CPT format
We can convert both CDT stations data and NetCDF gridded data to CPT format. Here, we will work with a dataset to convert dataset to CPT format.

### Converting NetCDF/GeoTIFF/ESRI .hdr Labelled
Here, we will see how CDT allows a user to convert raster data from one format to another. 

### Fillling missing dekadal temperature values
