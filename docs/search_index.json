CDT is a free, open source R package specifically designed for national meteorological services which allow the users to organize meteorological data, assess data availability, assess and correct data quality issues, combine station observations with satellite and reanalysis data, extract data from gridded products, analyze and visualize observation and gridded data. CDT allow a user to do all of these things at the comfort of click and select without requiring the user to write even a single line of code. The user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) provided by CDT makes the climatological data management and analysis a breeze. This book walks users through all the functionalities of CDT with practical examples. Upon completing this book, a reader will be able to do the quality control, manipulation, analysis and visualization of meteorological data. "],

We can extract data by coordinates of a single point, by coordinates of multiple points, by rectangle, by one polygon or even multiple polygons. We show here how to extract data using all these options. 2.8 Split NetCDF files into CDT NetCDF format Sometimes NetCDF files have many more dimensions, for example, one NetCDF file might contain values for multiple years in a single file. 2.9 Blank grid outside polygons 2.10 Data format conversion 2.10.1 Conversion to CPT format We can convert both CDT stations data and NetCDF gridded data to CPT format. Here, we will work with a dataset to convert dataset to CPT format. 2.10.2 Converting NetCDF/GeoTIFF/ESRI .hdr Labelled Here, we will see how CDT allows a user to convert raster data from one format to another. 2.10.3 Fillling missing dekadal temperature values 2.11 Exercise "],

We can create gridded data from CDT stations data format using spatially inerpolation. Under this menubar, we can merge rainfall data with station data and create merged dataset. We can also merge temperature data with reanalysis data. We also have the option of scaling merged data and doing cross-validation of rainfall and temperature data. Topics included in this chapter are: Spatial interpolation Merging rainfall data Merging temperature data Scale merged data Merging - Cross-validation 4.1 Spatial interpolation We can conduct spatial interpolation of CDT station data format with different time frequency to create gridded data. Using 7 different interpolation techniques we can do the interpolation. Either we can define a grid by ourselves or mention a netCDF file which will be used to specify the grid for the interpolated data. After we are done with interpolating, we can also plot this newly created dataset. 4.2 Merging rainfall data There are 3 steps that need to be executed for merging rainfall data with station data. Compute bias coefficients Apply bias correction Merging data 4.2.1 Compute bias coefficients 4.2.2 Apply bias correction 4.2.3 Merging data 4.3 Merging tremperature data There sare 5 steps in merging observational temperature data with reanalysis data.

We can do different kinds of time series aggregation based on different conditions. Output time series can be viewed in different time step formats such as monthlty, seasonal and annual. Different types of time series graph are also also generated, which are line plot, barplot, probability graph, line and bar graph indicating ENSO years, graph with ENSO probability and anomaly plot. 6.5 Daily rainfall analysis This allows to conduct different analysis on daily rainfall data. We can compute seasonal daily statistics such as total rainfall, rainfall intensity, number of wet days, number of dry days, number of wet spells, number of dry spells. We can also calculate yearly seasonal statistics such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, probability of exceeding etc. In doing so, we can manually define wet/dry day. Finally, these results can also be visualized. 6.6 Rainy season characteristics We can calculate different characteristics if rainy season such as season onset, season cessation and season length. 6.6.1 Season onset 6.6.2 Season cessation 6.6.3 Season length 6.7 Rainy season analysis We can conduct different analysis of rainy season and we can show rainy season analysis in term of line plot, barplot, probability graph, line and bar graph indicating ENSO years, graph with ENSO probability and anomaly plot. 6.8 Climate extreme indices We can compute different climate extreme indices in terms of both rainfall and temperature. 6.8.1 Precipitation data 6.8.2 Temperature data 6.9 Drought indices We can compute different drought indices in CDT.
